## Daily Study Log

| Date | Session | What I practiced | Time | 1-line insight |
|------|---------|------------------|------|----------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | JS Drill | `myMap` | 25m | e.g., “Skipped holes via `i in arr`.” |

### How to Use
- **Weeks**: Put exercises under `week-0X`.
- **JS drills**: Tiny pure functions, 1 file each, plus a short explanation comment at the top.
- **React micro-builds**: Single-file TSX components; keep state minimal.
- **Playground**: Use `playgrounds/react-vite` to run/preview React components quickly.

## Tonight’s Warm-up (suggested)
- Implement `myMap(arr, fn)` (skip holes).
- Build `ColorList` (buttons from colors, show selected, clear).

## Commands

From the repo root:

```bash
# one-time
npm i

# run React playground
cd playgrounds/react-vite
npm i
npm run dev
